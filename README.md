# FIle_filtering
Application developed to EE validation with the propose of facilitate the validation activity by filtering files aiming to delete not applicable requirements.
Using the pysimpplegui library an interface has been build to the user choose eighter a specific file or the root directory where all ".docm" files will be filtered.
Once the files have ".docm" extension the library docx needed to be modified to accept this file extension (attached here).
Some improvemets were apllied to the app, now there is an interface where all applied tests are displayed to the user and there is a way to navigate trhough the file and flag all non-compliant items.

```Next steps:

- integration with GCP;
- Integration with google drive;
- Develop an image management strategy.```
